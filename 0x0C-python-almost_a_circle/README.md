# 0x0c-python-almost_a_circle

Welcome to the "Almost a Circle" project! This project is a part of the ALX curriculum, specifically for learning and practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

## Overview
The **0x0c-python-almost_a_circle** project is designed to help you solidify your understanding of classes, inheritance, and other OOP principles in Python. You'll be working with classes that represent geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares, and gradually adding functionality to them.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several files and directories:

- **models/**: This directory contains the Python files defining the classes for rectangles and squares.
- **tests/**: Here you'll find the unit tests for the project, ensuring that your implementations meet the expected behavior.
- **README.md**: You're reading it right now! This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <Enter HTML of repository>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x0c-python-almost_a_circle`

## Usage

Once you've set up the project, you can use the provided Python scripts to interact with the classes and test your implementations.

- **models/base.py**: Contains the `Base` class, the base of all other classes in the project.
- **models/rectangle.py**: Defines the `Rectangle` class, representing a rectangle.
- **models/square.py**: Defines the `Square` class, a special case of a rectangle with equal width and height.
- **tests/**: Contains the unit tests for each class and its methods.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any bugs, issues, or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
