# Python Inheritance

Python supports inheritance, allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. 
Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the creation of a hierarchical structure among classes. 
In Python, a subclass can inherit from a single superclass, but a superclass can have multiple subclasses. 
Subclasses can override methods and attributes of their superclass, providing flexibility in modifying behavior. 
To create a subclass, use the syntax `class SubClassName(SuperClassName):`. 
Inherited methods and attributes can be accessed using the subclass instance. 
Python's inheritance mechanism facilitates the creation of complex yet maintainable code structures.
