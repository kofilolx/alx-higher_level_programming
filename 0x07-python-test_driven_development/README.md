# Test-driven Development Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at implementing Test-driven Development (TDD) practices in software development. Test-driven development is a methodology in which tests are written before the actual code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements and remains maintainable through automated testing.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to promote software quality, reliability, and maintainability by incorporating TDD into the development process. By writing tests first, developers can clarify the expected behavior of the code, design modular and loosely coupled components, and catch bugs early in the development cycle.

## Features

- Implementation of test cases using a testing framework (e.g., JUnit for Java, pytest for Python).
- Writing unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests to cover different aspects of the software.
- Continuous Integration (CI) setup to automatically run tests upon code changes.
- Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with other developers.
